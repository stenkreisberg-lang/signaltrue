# Privacy and GDPR Compliance

## Our Privacy Philosophy

SignalTrue is built from the ground up with privacy as a core design principle, not an afterthought. We believe organizations can gain valuable insights about team health without compromising individual privacy.

## GDPR Compliance

### Legal Basis for Processing

SignalTrue operates under the legal basis of **legitimate interest** for organizational improvement, with the following safeguards:

- Only metadata is processed, never content
- Team-level aggregation (minimum 5 people) ensures no individual identification
- Transparent documentation of all data processing
- Data minimization principles applied throughout

### Data Subject Rights

Even though our aggregation prevents individual identification, we support:

- **Right to Information**: Clear documentation of what we process
- **Right to Object**: Organizations can exclude specific teams
- **Right to Erasure**: All data can be deleted upon request
- **Right to Portability**: Aggregated data exports available

### Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

SignalTrue provides a comprehensive DPA that includes:

- Sub-processor list and notification of changes
- Data processing locations
- Security measures
- Breach notification procedures
- Audit rights

## What SignalTrue Does NOT Process

For absolute clarity on privacy protection:

1. **No message content** - We never read emails, chats, or messages
2. **No document access** - We never access files or documents
3. **No individual tracking** - All metrics are team-level (min 5 people)
4. **No surveillance** - No screen monitoring, keystroke logging, or activity tracking
5. **No profiling** - No individual behavioral profiles or scores

## Privacy by Design

### Aggregation at Collection

Data is aggregated before storage:
- Individual data points are never stored
- Only team-level metrics are calculated and retained
- Minimum team size of 5 ensures statistical anonymity

### Purpose Limitation

Data is used only for:
- Team behavioral intelligence
- Organizational health insights
- Trend analysis and forecasting

Data is NEVER used for:
- Individual performance assessment
- Disciplinary purposes
- AI/ML model training
- Third-party sharing (except sub-processors)

### Data Minimization

We collect only what's needed:
- Metadata, not content
- Timestamps and patterns, not details
- Aggregate metrics, not individual data

## International Data Transfers

- Primary processing in EU/EEA when possible
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers outside EEA
- AWS and Google Cloud with EU data residency options
- No data sharing with third parties beyond essential sub-processors

## Security Measures

Technical and organizational measures include:

- End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest)
- SOC 2 Type II certified infrastructure
- Regular penetration testing
- Access controls and audit logging
- Employee security training and background checks

## Works Council / Employee Representative Considerations

For organizations with works councils:

- SignalTrue is not a monitoring tool and doesn't require works council approval in most jurisdictions
- We provide documentation to support works council discussions
- Our privacy-first approach aligns with employee protection requirements
- No individual data means no surveillance concerns

## Privacy Documentation

We provide:

- Detailed DPA for enterprise customers
- Technical security documentation
- Privacy impact assessment templates
- Works council FAQ documents
- Sub-processor list
