# HR Leader FAQ

## General Questions

### What is SignalTrue?

SignalTrue is a team behavioral intelligence platform that helps HR leaders understand team dynamics and collaboration patterns at an aggregate level. We provide early warning signals about team health without invasive monitoring.

### How is this different from employee monitoring software?

SignalTrue is fundamentally different from monitoring tools:

| Monitoring Software | SignalTrue |
|-------------------|------------|
| Reads message content | Never reads content |
| Tracks individuals | Team-level only (min 5 people) |
| Creates surveillance | No surveillance |
| Performance scores | No individual scores |
| Erodes trust | Builds trust through transparency |

### Does SignalTrue read employee messages or emails?

**No, absolutely not.** SignalTrue only analyzes metadata (timestamps, patterns, network structure) and never accesses message content, email bodies, or any text.

### Can managers see individual employee activity?

**No.** All SignalTrue data is aggregated at the team level with a minimum of 5 people. There is no way to view individual activity or "drill down" to specific employees.

## Privacy and Trust

### How do we explain this to employees?

We recommend transparent communication:

- "We're using SignalTrue to understand team health at the group level"
- "It only looks at patterns like meeting load and collaboration frequency"
- "It never reads messages or tracks individual activity"
- "Minimum 5 people per group means no individual identification"

### Will employees feel surveilled?

SignalTrue is specifically designed to avoid surveillance dynamics:

- No individual tracking or scores
- No access to content
- Team-level insights only
- Transparent methodology

Many organizations find that explaining SignalTrue's privacy-first approach actually builds trust.

### Do we need works council approval?

In most jurisdictions, SignalTrue does not require works council approval because:

- It's not a monitoring tool
- No individual data is processed
- Team-level aggregation (min 5 people)
- No surveillance capabilities

However, we recommend consulting with your legal team and being transparent with employee representatives.

## Use Cases

### What kinds of insights does SignalTrue provide?

Examples of team-level insights:

- "Team Alpha has 30% higher meeting load than benchmark"
- "Collaboration patterns suggest possible silos between teams"
- "Response time patterns indicate potential burnout risk"
- "Cross-team coordination has decreased 20% this quarter"

### Can SignalTrue help with retention?

Yes, by identifying early warning signs at the team level:

- Teams with unsustainable workload patterns
- Groups with declining collaboration health
- Warning signals before issues become visible

### Can this be used for performance reviews?

**No, and this is by design.** SignalTrue provides no individual data that could be used for performance assessment. This is intentional to maintain trust and focus on team health.

### How does this help with hybrid/remote work?

SignalTrue helps understand:
- Collaboration patterns across distributed teams
- Meeting load in remote contexts
- Cross-timezone coordination health
- Team connectivity in hybrid setups
