# SignalTrue Product Overview

## What is SignalTrue?

SignalTrue is a team behavioral intelligence platform designed to help organizations understand team dynamics and collaboration patterns at an aggregate level. We provide insights that help leaders make better decisions about team health, workload distribution, and organizational effectiveness.

## Core Value Proposition

SignalTrue helps organizations:

- **Identify early warning signs** of team burnout or disengagement before they become critical
- **Understand collaboration patterns** across teams and departments
- **Make data-driven decisions** about team structure and resource allocation
- **Protect employee wellbeing** through aggregate behavioral insights

## Key Differentiators

### Privacy-First Approach

Unlike traditional monitoring tools, SignalTrue:

- Analyzes only **metadata**, never message content
- Operates at **team level only** (minimum 5 people per analysis group)
- Never tracks individual employee behavior or performance
- Provides insights without surveillance

### Behavioral Intelligence, Not Monitoring

SignalTrue is **not a monitoring tool**. We do not:

- Read emails or messages
- Track keystrokes or screen activity
- Monitor individual productivity
- Create individual performance scores

Instead, we analyze patterns in team collaboration metadata to surface actionable insights about organizational health.

- **HR Leaders** who want to understand team dynamics without invasive monitoring
- **IT Leaders** who need a solution that respects privacy and security requirements
- **CEOs and Executives** who want aggregate insights into organizational health
- **People Operations Teams** who want to proactively address team challenges
