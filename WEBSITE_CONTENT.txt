SIGNALS SECTION:

SECTION LABEL: Signals
HEADING 2: Leading indicators HR can act on
SUBHEADING: We measure team-level patterns only. No individual dashboards. No message content.

SIGNAL 1:
Meeting Load and Fragmentation
See when meeting volume and back-to-back scheduling start squeezing execution time.

SIGNAL 2:
After-hours Load
Track late-night and weekend activity trends that often precede sustained burnout risk.

SIGNAL 3:
Focus Time Erosion
Detect shrinking uninterrupted blocks during working hours before delivery slows down.

SIGNAL 4:
Response Drag
Spot rising response times that signal overload or breakdowns in coordination.

SIGNAL 5:
Participation Drift
Identify drops in team contribution patterns and uneven load distribution at team level.

SIGNAL 6:
Team Comparisons
Prioritize support by showing which teams deviate most from their own baselines.

HOW IT WORKS SECTION:

SECTION LABEL: How it works
HEADING 2: Detect. Diagnose. Intervene. Measure.

Review signals
See which teams shifted, what changed, and where the risk is building.

STEP 04:
Take action and track impact
Choose an intervention, assign an owner, and track whether signals improve over time.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION LABEL: About
HEADING 1: We build team health tools that respect privacy
SUBHEADING: SignalTrue gives HR leading indicators of overload risk using team-level analytics, without turning collaboration tools into surveillance.

---

STORY SECTION:

SECTION LABEL: Why we built SignalTrue
HEADING 2: Leading indicators for modern work

BODY:
Teams drift into overload long before it shows up in engagement scores or exit interviews. The signals are often visible in meeting load, after-hours activity, and coordination friction. SignalTrue was built to make those patterns visible at team level, then guide action with a simple loop: Detect → Diagnose → Intervene → Measure.

---

PRINCIPLES SECTION:

SECTION LABEL: Our principles
HEADING 2: What we believe

PRINCIPLE 1:
Trust and transparency
Employees deserve clarity about what is collected and why.

PRINCIPLE 2:
Action over dashboards
Insights matter only if managers can use them to change outcomes.

PRINCIPLE 3:
Privacy by design
Team-level analytics only. No message content. No individual scoring.
