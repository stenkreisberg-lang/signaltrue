        <h2>What is a burnout early warning system?</h2>
        <p>A burnout early warning system tracks <strong>leading indicators</strong> — behavioral patterns that change before people quit, disengage, or burn out.</p>
        <p>Unlike engagement surveys that capture feelings after damage is done, a burnout early warning system detects <strong>baseline drift</strong> — when a team's normal work patterns shift in a risky direction, gradually, before anyone calls it burnout.</p>
        <p>SignalTrue measures team-level behavior patterns like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meeting overload and calendar compression</li>
          <li>Recovery time collapse between meetings</li>
          <li>After-hours work drift into nights and weekends</li>
          <li>Focus fragmentation and context switching</li>
          <li>Responsiveness pressure in collaboration tools</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These signals come from <strong>privacy-safe metadata</strong> from work tools — not message content, not individual tracking.</p>

        <h2>What are burnout leading indicators?</h2>
        <p>Leading indicators are behavioral patterns that change <strong>before</strong> people report feeling burned out. They predict burnout, rather than confirming it after the fact.</p>

    <!-- Why surveys fail -->
    <section id="why-surveys-fail" class="content-section">
      <div class="container content-narrow">
        <h2>Why surveys fail as early warning</h2>
        <p>Engagement surveys have been the default tool for understanding employee wellbeing. But they fail as early warning systems for several reasons:</p>
        
        <h3>1. They measure feelings, not behavior</h3>
        <p>Feelings are lagging indicators. By the time someone feels burned out enough to report it, the damage is already done — to their health, their performance, and potentially their decision to leave.</p>
        
        <h3>2. They arrive too late</h3>
        <p>Annual or quarterly surveys provide snapshots of the past. A Q3 survey tells you how people felt in Q3 — not how they feel now, and not what's changing week-to-week.</p>
        
        <h3>3. They suffer from response bias</h3>
        <p>People may not feel safe being honest. They may not recognize their own burnout. Or they may have already mentally checked out and stopped engaging with surveys at all.</p>
        
        <h3>4. They don't show drift</h3>
        <p>Surveys give you a score. They don't show you the trajectory — whether things are getting better or worse, and how fast.</p>
        
        <p class="callout">A burnout early warning system doesn't replace surveys entirely. But it provides the <strong>continuous, behavior-based signals</strong> that surveys can't — so you can act before it's too late.</p>

    <!-- How to act without blaming individuals -->
    <section id="act-without-blame" class="content-section">
      <div class="container content-narrow">
        <h2>How leaders act on signals without blaming individuals</h2>
        <p>Early warning signals are meant to trigger <strong>system-level interventions</strong>, not individual scrutiny. Here's how to use them effectively:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Focus on team patterns, not people</h3>
        <p>SignalTrue shows team-level signals only. When meeting overload rises, the question isn't "who is scheduling too many meetings?" — it's "what's causing our team to need so many meetings?"</p>
        
        <h3>2. Look for root causes</h3>
        <p>Rising after-hours drift often signals unclear priorities, not lazy workers. Recovery collapse often signals poor meeting hygiene, not individual time management failures.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Make structural changes</h3>
        <p>Effective interventions are structural:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce recurring meeting frequency</li>
          <li>Create protected focus blocks</li>
          <li>Clarify decision-making authority</li>
          <li>Set explicit async communication norms</li>
          <li>Redistribute work when load is uneven</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Track signal response, not individual behavior</h3>
        <p>After making changes, track whether the <strong>signal</strong> improves. Did meeting overload decrease? Did after-hours drift stabilize? The signal tells you if your intervention worked.</p>
        
        <p class="callout"><strong>Weekly Signal Review:</strong> A 15-minute weekly signal review helps leaders correct drift early, before it becomes burnout, conflict, or attrition.</p>
