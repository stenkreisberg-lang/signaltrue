    <!-- Lagging vs Leading -->
    <section id="lagging-vs-leading" class="content-section">
      <div class="container content-narrow">
        <h2>Engagement lagging vs leading indicators</h2>
        <p>Most organizations measure employee engagement with surveys. But surveys are <strong>lagging indicators</strong> — they tell you how people felt, not how they're feeling or what's about to change.</p>
        
        <h3>The problem with lagging indicators</h3>
        <p>When you run a quarterly engagement survey, you're measuring feelings that formed over the past 3 months. By the time results come in, are analyzed, and action plans are created, another month has passed. The data is 4+ months old.</p>
        
        <p>If someone was disengaging, they may have already resigned. If a team was burning out, the damage is already done.</p>
        
        <h3>What leading indicators reveal</h3>
        <p>Leading indicators are <strong>behavioral patterns</strong> that change before feelings crystallize. They include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meeting overload</strong> — Calendar density that predicts burnout</li>
          <li><strong>Collaboration breadth decline</strong> — Reduced cross-team interaction</li>
          <li><strong>After-hours drift</strong> — Work spillover indicating boundary erosion</li>
          <li><strong>Responsiveness pressure</strong> — Compressed response expectations</li>
          <li><strong>Recovery time collapse</strong> — Shrinking gaps between meetings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These patterns change <strong>weeks before</strong> survey scores decline — giving you time to intervene.</p>

        <h2>What "disengagement drift" looks like</h2>
        <p>Disengagement doesn't happen overnight. It's a gradual drift — a slow shift in behavioral patterns that precedes conscious awareness of disengagement.</p>
        
        <h3>The anatomy of disengagement drift</h3>
        
        <div class="drift-timeline">
          <div class="drift-stage">
            <h4>Stage 1: Overload builds</h4>

            <h4>What are employee engagement leading indicators?</h4>
            <p>Employee engagement leading indicators are behavioral patterns that predict disengagement before people report feeling disengaged. They include meeting overload, declining collaboration breadth, after-hours drift, and responsiveness pressure — patterns that change weeks before survey scores decline.</p>

            <h4>Why are surveys lagging indicators of engagement?</h4>
            <p>Engagement surveys measure how people feel at a point in time — they're snapshots of the past. By the time survey results show declining engagement, the behavioral patterns shifted weeks or months earlier. Leading indicators detect this drift in real-time.</p>

            <p>Disengagement drift is the gradual shift in work patterns that precedes conscious disengagement. It includes reduced collaboration, declining response patterns, and withdrawal from discretionary activities — observable in metadata before feelings crystallize.</p>
