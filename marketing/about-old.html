          <h3>The Story</h3>
          <p class="muted">SignalTrue was founded by engineering leaders who were tired of guessing why teams were burning out. We realized that while we had dashboards for server health, we had zero visibility into organizational health until someone quit. We built SignalTrue to give leaders the same fidelity for their teams that they have for their infrastructure.</p>

          <p class="muted">SignalTrue does not track keystrokes, screen activity, message content, or individual behavior. All insights are derived from team-level collaboration patterns and are intended to support leadership decisions, not employee surveillance.</p>
