          <h2>The Problem: Invisible Drift</h2>
          <div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left;">
            <p>Modern work is fragmented across dozens of tools. When teams start to struggle—whether it's meeting overload, isolation, or burnout—it happens invisibly, in the digital exhaust of calendars and chat logs.</p>
            <p>By the time a leader notices something is wrong, it's usually too late. Someone has quit, a project has failed, or the culture has already soured.</p>
            <p><strong>Why not just ask people?</strong> Surveys are slow, biased, and suffer from fatigue. They tell you how people felt two weeks ago, not how they are working today.</p>
            <p><strong>Why not monitor activity?</strong> Traditional "employee monitoring" is invasive, destroys trust, and focuses on the wrong things (like keystrokes or "active time"). It measures busyness, not health.</p>

            <h3>Our Solution: Metadata & Aggregation</h3>
            <p class="muted">We chose a different path. We look at <strong>metadata</strong> (timestamps, volume, patterns) not content. And we aggregate everything to the <strong>team level</strong>.</p>
            <p class="muted">This gives leaders the visibility they need to make decisions without violating the privacy or trust of their people.</p>

          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Our principles</h3>
            <p class="muted">Privacy first. Humans over metrics. Actionable by default. No surveillance. No judgment—just clarity and coaching.</p>

          <h3>The Story</h3>
          <p class="muted">SignalTrue was founded by engineering leaders who were tired of guessing why teams were burning out. We realized that while we had dashboards for server health, we had zero visibility into organizational health until someone quit. We built SignalTrue to give leaders the same fidelity for their teams that they have for their infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>What SignalTrue does not do</h2>
          <p class="muted">SignalTrue does not track keystrokes, screen activity, message content, or individual behavior. All insights are derived from team-level collaboration patterns and are intended to support leadership decisions, not employee surveillance.</p>
